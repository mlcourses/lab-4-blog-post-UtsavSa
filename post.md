# Lab X: Doing stuff with hardware!

Please write a blog post describing your lab here.

This is just an example of how you might structure your blog post, feel free to edit as you wish. For example, you might divide the lab into different sections each with their own intro, instructions, results, and takeaways. Please see the rubric for details on how the post will be evaluated.

## Overview and Motivation
This week we'll explore...

## Materials

## Project Steps

## Part 1: Buzzer




## Part 2: Servo


## Part 3: Ultrasonic Sensor



## Part 4: Photoresistor




## Design Challenge: Distance Detector

 
 **- For this design challenge:** We built a handheld proximity detector that emits a sound whose pitch correlates with the distance to a nearby object. There were a few requirements we needed to to hit to make this a proper **Distance Detector**.

 -  We need to make sure that our device (Distance Detector) should be sensitive to and respond correspondingly to distances that span from vary close (1 cm or less) to a distance of 100 cm (1 meter).

 - We also need to make sure our device emits a sound tone in relation to the distance. For example, we used a low-pitched tone to indicate a far distance (100cm). Similarly, we used a high-pitched tone to indicate a near distance (1 cm or less). This means, we also need to make sure that we are emiting sound in relation to the distance i.e. how far an object is or how close it is, should have different and unique sound tones in relation to one another.



**Steps:** Having built a Buzzer and Ultrasonic Sensor before working on this Digital Design was a very big help. After independantly building each of these Sensors in our Arduino Breadboard, and learning how they function using the Arduino Code, building the Distance Detector was much easier. This is because we had to combine the knowledge of how a buzzer works and also how the Ultrasonic Sensor works to successfully build a distance detector which has functionality of both, "a Buzzer" and "an Ultrasonic Sensor" combined.





In Short, We used the steps needed to build a buzzer and the steps needed to build an Ultrasonic Sensor to build these in our breadboard. After this, all we needed was implement the Arduino Code to make sure it functions as intended.
